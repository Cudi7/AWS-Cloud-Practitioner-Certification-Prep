# AWS CLF-C02 Quiz App ☁️

Welcome to the **AWS CLF-C02 Quiz App**! 🎉

This app is designed to help you (and me!) prepare for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification exam by providing quiz questions that cover key topics. It’s built using the [**T3 Stack**](https://create.t3.gg/) as a boilerplate, leveraging the power of **Next.js App Router**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 🌐

## 🚀 Features

- **[Normal Quiz Mode](https://aws-cloud-practitioner-certification-prep.vercel.app/quiz)**: Start from question 1 and progress through to the end. Your progress is saved in `localStorage`, so you can pick up right where you left off. 💾
- **[Random Quiz Mode](https://aws-cloud-practitioner-certification-prep.vercel.app/quiz/random)**: Tackle random questions from the quiz pool. Note that progress isn’t saved here—perfect for quick practice! 🎲
- **[Practice Mistakes](https://aws-cloud-practitioner-certification-prep.vercel.app/quiz/mistakes)**: Review all the questions you’ve previously answered incorrectly. This mode collects mistakes from both the normal and random quizzes, giving you a focused way to improve. 🔄
- **Progress Reset**: You can reset all your progress at any time. 🔃
- **Rating System**: Get immediate feedback on whether you're passing or failing the quiz based on your performance in Normal Quiz Mode. 📊

- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes based on your preference. 🌙☀️
